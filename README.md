# PingPersonInHouse

This project makes it possible to find out in your own house whether a person is <br> there on the one hand and whether they are also online on the other.
<br>
In order for the script to work, only the appropriate IP address of the device <br> that is to be pinged must be entered.
<br>
The script can then be integrated without any problems.
<br>
Improvements and suggestions are welcome.
